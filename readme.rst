What is this repository?
########################

The original CodeIgniter 3.x branch is no longer maintained. This fork is intended to be a continuation of CI3, and maybe eventually make it more compatible with CI4 (maybe).

This is a fork of CodeIgniter 3, with PHP 8, webp/avif, redis, utf8, and other features.
